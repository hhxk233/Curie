# APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection
> Prerequisites: Ensure you have installed `mlebench` following [instructions](../README.md).

Given a dataset of retinal images, predict the severity level of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4. This is a multi-class classification task with medical significance.

## Dataset Overview

The APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset contains high-resolution retinal images, classified into five severity levels:
- 0: No diabetic retinopathy
- 1: Mild diabetic retinopathy
- 2: Moderate diabetic retinopathy
- 3: Severe diabetic retinopathy
- 4: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

This challenge addresses a critical healthcare issue as millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working-aged adults. Early detection can prevent blindness.

## Download Dataset

```bash
mlebench prepare -c aptos2019-blindness-detection
```

## Run Curie
- Update the configuration: Open `curie/configs/mle-aptos-config.json` and verify the paths to the dataset and starter code.
- Execute Curie:
```bash
cd Curie/
python3 -m curie.main -f benchmark/mle_bench/aptos2019-blindness-detection/question.txt --task_config curie/configs/mle_config.json --dataset_dir /home/amberljc/.cache/mle-bench/data/aptos2019-blindness-detection/prepared/public 
```
- Change `--dataset_dir` to the absolute path to your dataset.

### Curie Performance Summary

The agent's experiments yielded impressive results for diabetic retinopathy detection:

- **Best Model**: EfficientNet-B5 with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Quadratic Weighted Kappa**: 0.9058 (benchmark metric for this task)
- **Classification Accuracy**: 82.50%
- **Model Architecture Comparison**:
  - ResNet50 (baseline): Kappa 0.7733
  - EfficientNet-B3: Kappa 0.8108
  - EfficientNet-B5: Kappa 0.9058
